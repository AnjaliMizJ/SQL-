**DATA MART**

***Case Study Questions**
The following case study questions require some data cleaning steps before we start to unpack Dannyâ€™s key business questions in more depth.

1. Data Cleansing Steps
In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:

Convert the week_date to a DATE format

Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc

Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column

Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values

Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

segment	age_band
1	Young Adults
2	Middle Aged
3 or 4	Retirees
Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:
segment	demographic
C	Couples
F	Families
Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns

Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

    SELECT TO_DATE( week_date,'YY/MM/DD') as week_datA, 
          EXTRACT(WEEK FROM TO_DATE( week_date,'YY-MM-DD')) AS WEEK_NUM,
          EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE( week_date,'YY-MM-DD')) AS MONTH_NUM,
          EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE( week_date,'YY-MM-DD')) AS CALENAR_YEAR,
          (CASE WHEN segment=NULL THEN 'unknown'
 		                ELSE segment
 		        END) AS segment,
          (CASE 
 		            WHEN RIGHT(segment,1)='1' THEN 'Young Adults' 
		            WHEN RIGHT(segment,1)='2' THEN 'Middle Aged' 
                WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) in ('3','4') THEN 'Retirees' 
                ELSE 'unknown'
            END) AS age_band,
          (CASE 
 		            WHEN LEFT(segment,1)='C' THEN 'couples' 
		            WHEN LEFT(segment,1)='F' THEN 'families' 
                ELSE 'unknown'
                END) AS demographics,
          ROUND(sales/transactions,2) AS avg_transaction 

        FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
        LIMIT 10;
